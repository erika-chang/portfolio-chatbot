# Career Story

Erika began in **biomolecular physics** at the **University of SÃ£o Paulo**, where she modeled proteins, ran HPC-accelerated analyses, and published peer-reviewed papers.
This built her foundation in **Python**, **statistical modeling**, and **reproducible workflows**.

Transitioning to **teaching**, she developed strong communication and storytelling skills, using data to improve student outcomes.

In 2023 she pivoted into applied data science at **TIPREV**, building **forecasting** and **fraud-risk** models for municipal pension data and automating ETL pipelines.
That experience directly connected her to the **finance** and **consulting** sectors.

To consolidate her new path, she completed the **Le Wagon Data Science & AI Bootcamp (2025)**, creating projects like **Eyesense** (deep-learning for eye-disease detection) and **SecureMed Chat** (a privacy-focused RAG assistant).
These projects extended her expertise into **bioinformatics / health-adjacent analytics** and **GenAI deployment**.

Today she focuses on roles in **finance**, **bioinformatics**, and **consulting**, where she can combine research-grade rigor, technical delivery, and clear communication.
